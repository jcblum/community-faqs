# RStudio Community FAQ Revamp

As part of my 2019 internship with RStudio, I embarked on a top-to-bottom revamp of [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com)'s FAQ documentation and user guides. In some cases, this involved copy edits and small tweaks to improve clarity and organization. In other cases, I rewrote entire articles, or wrote entirely new collections of guides.

## Improving reproducible example guidance

A key goal of refreshing the FAQs was to improve our guidance on the nuts and bolts of composing reproducible examples, with an eye especially to those new to programming and to R. This large sub-project involved writing several new guides. The drafts live in their own repository:

### :link: **[Reprex How-To](https://github.com/jcblum/reprex-howto)**

## Major rewrites

The final drafts of FAQ articles that were completely rewritten are contained in this repo. Further updates and changes will occur on the Community site itself, so refer to the link for the latest version.

### FAQ: How do I track categories or tags? / FAQ: How do I change how I'm notified about a discussion?

_These two existing articles had largely overlapping content. Since they both have inbound links, I left them as-is for the time being, but used the same contents for both. Probably one should be deleted and/or re-directed to the other._

- Current version: https://community.rstudio.com/t/22342 or https://community.rstudio.com/t/19382
